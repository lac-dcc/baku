The new i7 CPU has a larger L3 cache (8MB vs 6MB). This will lead to fewer cache misses, meaning the CPU spends less time stalled waiting for data from main memory. With fewer stalls, the program can be executed more efficiently, requiring fewer total cycles to complete the same work, even though the observed clock speed in this specific run was lower.\n\n*   **Instructions: The same value.**\n    The number of instructions is determined by the compiled program itself, not the CPU it runs on. Since it is the same program, the CPU will have to execute the exact same sequence and number of machine instructions to complete its task.\n\n*   **Cache References: The same value.**\n    Similar to instructions, cache references are a product of the program's memory access pattern. The program will try to access the same data in the same order, regardless of the underlying CPU. Therefore, the number of times it asks the cache for data will remain the same.\n\n*   **Cache Misses: A significantly lower value.**\n    This is the most direct impact of the hardware change. The new i7 CPU has a larger cache (8MB vs 6MB). A larger cache can hold more of the program's data and instructions, which directly reduces the number of times the CPU has to fetch data from the much slower main memory. This improvement will cause the number of cache misses to drop.", "program": "array6_7", "origin": "natan", "destination": "guima"}

Since the new CPU has a larger cache, we expect fewer cache misses. This reduction in stalls means the program can be completed in fewer total clock cycles.\n*   **Instructions would remain approximately the same:** The number of instructions is determined by the program's code itself, not the CPU it runs on. Since the program is the same, the sequence of machine instructions to be executed will not change.\n*   **Cache References would remain approximately the same:** Similar to instructions, the number of times the program attempts to access memory is a function of the program's logic. This fundamental access pattern does not change when moving to a new CPU.\n*   **Cache Misses would decrease:** This is the most direct and certain change.
