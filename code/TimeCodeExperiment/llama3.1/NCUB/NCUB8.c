#include<stdio.h> 
` tags, the output will not be displayed. Instead, the code will be displayed as is. 

**Note**: The code is a completion of the base code, and it does not require any additional input or output. The code is self-contained and can be compiled and run as is. 

**Additional Notes**:

* The code uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of even numbers, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs.
* The code does not handle the case where `b` and `c` are not used in the function. They can be removed to simplify the code.
* The code uses `printf` to print a message in the dead conditional statement, which is not necessary and can be removed.
* The code does not have any error handling or input validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior for invalid inputs. 

Overall, the code is a good implementation of the problem statement, but it can be improved by adding error handling, input validation, and removing unnecessary code.
